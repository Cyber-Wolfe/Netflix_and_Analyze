# Netflix and Analyze
Analysis of movie critic data to determine if there are implicit biases from each site.

## Topic and Why
Our topic will be about movie critic ratings and whether there is a trend of biased movie reviews based on genre between the critic services. This topic was selected because critic reviews vary from site to site. It may be by 10 points or 50 points and we were wondering if one movie critic source was better than another for certain genres.

## Data Overview
We found multiple datasets of critic reviews broken down by what critic service the reviews were pulled from, box office earnings, genre of the movie, and the movie rating (PG-13, R, PG). We have even come across datasets that break down the movie score by the critic it was given from. 

## Questions

* Use the dataset to find a bias in the critic review score:

* Relationship between the movie rating and the box office earnings?
    * Biased critique of a movie may impact box office earnings negatively.
    * Critics and services could be doing the movie industry a disservice with biased           
        reviews, not allowing a movie to reach its full potential in sales even if customers would enjoy it

### Roles: 

Jean Pierre: Database mockup 

Josh Wolfe: Leading repository structure and requests

Ethan Freeze: Giving direction on technologies to use

Suman:  Working on machine learning models

### Channels:

Our group will utilize Discord, Whatsapp, and github to communicate throughout the project. Discord will be used as a resource sharing platform, for code, troubleshooting larger issues, meetings, and screenshos of work in progress. Whatsapp will be for quick communication and assistance for the day-to-day. Github will be ultimately utilized for filesharing and uploading completed work that is ready for peer review.

## Tech Overview

The initial cleaning of our data had been done by translating the excel sheet and    We had dro Then the cleaned data will be placed into machine learning models and into a database to for easy querying of datasets to be analyzed.
