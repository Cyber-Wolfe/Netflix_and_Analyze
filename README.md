# Netflix and Analyze
Analysis of movie critic data to determine if there are implicit biases from each site.

### Preliminary Database Site
https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/


### Topic and Why
Our topic will be about movie critic ratings and whether there is a trend of biased movie reviews based on genre between the critic services. This topic was selected because critic reviews vary from site to site. It may be by 10 points or 50 points and we were wondering if one movie critic source was better than another.

### Data Overview and Questions
We found multiple datasets of critic reviews broken down by what critic service the reviews were pulled from, box office earnings, genre of the movie, the movie rating (pg-13, R, pg) we have even come across datasets that break it down by the actual critic. With these datasets we hope to conclude whether there is a bias in the critic review score, and what may be affecting the bias. The bias could be based on genre, or movie ratings.

Another question is if there is a relation between the movie rating and the box office earnings. The biased critique of a movie may have a negative impact on the box office earnings. If so it can be concluded that critic services are doing the movie industry a disservice by not allowing a movie to reach its full potential in sales.

We are all in a group slack, discord, whatsapp, and github. Slack, and discord will be used as a resource sharing platform. Whatsapp will be for quick communication and assistance. Discord will also be used as a out of class call collaboration platform. Github will be used for filesharing and uploading completed works that are ready to be peer reviewed.

### Tech Overview
We will clean the data through mysql. After cleaning the database we will bring it in to jupyter notebook and start making a model.
